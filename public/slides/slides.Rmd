# **Spectrograms** 
### <span style="color:blue">How to read them and What to look for:</span>
* A Spectrogram is used to visualize wave data
* The purpose is to show how frequency content of a wave changes over time
* It can be read like a heat map to look for temporal patterns in amplitude and frequency

---
# **Oscillogram** 
* Audio files are typically represented as waves
* Patterns observed in the wave file are retained in the spectrogram

* **Scale:** Humans perceive pitch on a log scale. Scaling the y axis represents the frequency spectrum with psychoacoustic experience of drums.

* **Scale:** Humans perceive pitch on a log scale. Scaling the y axis represents the frequency spectrum consistently with psychoacoustics.

* **Annotation:** Annotation can be used to supplement the graph with event identification. Here I labeled the events at the beginning so the rhythm pattern can be better understood.

* **Change Drumset:** The pattern here is the same but played with a different virtual instrument. The smearing indicates these sounds had longer decay times than the 808 drumkit.

* **Change Drumset:** The pattern here is the same but played with a different virtual instrument. The hi-hats were triggered with a lower velocity MIDI note so the event is very difficult to see.

* **Color:** Color is a built in feature of a spectrogram. The color is used to encode the amplitude of each frequency. Here color is not needed for quantitative precision so much as a way of visually separating high amplitude moments and low amplitude moments.
